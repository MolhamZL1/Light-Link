- 🧠 Multiple search and optimization algorithms.  
- 🖥️ User-friendly interface for puzzle interaction.  
- ⚡ Efficient state-space search for optimal solutions.  

## 🧩 Implemented Algorithms
This project includes the following search algorithms:
- ✅ **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- ✅ **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- ✅ **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**
- ✅ **Hill Climbing**
- ✅ **A* Search (A-star)**
- ✅ **Minimax Algorithm**

  🎮 How to Play

Objective

Place mirrors strategically to direct the light toward the target.

Choose a Level

The game has four levels of increasing complexity:

🟢 Level 1 (Beginner): Simple puzzles with few obstacles.

🔵 Level 2 (Intermediate): More mirrors and obstacles introduced.

🟠 Level 3 (Advanced): Complex puzzles requiring strategic placement.

🔴 Level 4 (Expert): The hardest challenges with multiple light sources and obstacles.

Select an Algorithm

Pick from DFS, BFS, UCS, Hill Climbing, A, or Minimax* to solve the puzzle.

Interact with the Board

Place and rotate mirrors to guide the light beam.

Adjust strategies based on the algorithm's suggestions.

Win the Level

The puzzle is solved when the light successfully reaches the target.
